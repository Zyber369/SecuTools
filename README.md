- To automate repetitive and complex security tasks, making them more accessible and efficient.
- To enhance users' security posture by offering easy-to-use security tools.

### The Problem Being Solved
SecuTools aims to address the complexity and time-consuming nature of various security tasks such as password management and network scanning. By automating these tasks, the tool helps users to focus on more critical security analysis and decision-making activities.

### Scope

1. **Password Management**:
   - Generate strong, random passwords.
   - Validate password strength.

2. **Network Scanning**:
   - Scan local networks for active devices.
   - Identify open ports on devices.

### Expected Outcomes and Deliverables
- A fully functional Python-based toolkit with the following features:
  - Password generation and validation functions.
  - Network scanning utilities.
- Comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions and usage examples.
- A GitHub repository containing the source code, documentation, and any additional resources.

### Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design (Week 1)**
   - Define detailed requirements and functionalities.
   - Design the software architecture.
   - Set up the GitHub repository.

2. **Phase 2: Development (Week 2)**
   - Implement password management functions.
   - Create network scanning capabilities.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Week 3)**
   - Perform unit and integration testing.
   - Validate the functionalities with test cases.

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Demonstration (Week 4)**
   - Document the code and usage instructions.
   - Create a demonstration script.
   - Finalize and deliver the project.

## Tool Demonstration

### 1. Password Management

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

def validate_password(password):
    if (len(password) >= 8 and
        any(c.isdigit() for c in password) and
        any(c.isupper() for c in password) and
        any(c.islower() for c in password) and
        any(c in string.punctuation for c in password)):
        return True
    return False

# Demo
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generated_password = generate_password()
    print("Generated Password:", generated_password)
    print("Password Validation:", validate_password(generated_password))
